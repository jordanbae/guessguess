## 📌 Project Description <a name = "desc"></a>
Guess the movies name from the the given hint.
- **Minimum players required** : 2
  > There will be 2 groups of players; the guesser and the people who give hints.

## 🕵️ Approach <a name = "approach"></a>
The main challenge of this project is to get list of words and display it randomly. My first approach was using API's but there were efficiency problems so I decided to get list of movies and kept it in JSON instead.
Loops and Array are the main heroes that make this game logic working.
